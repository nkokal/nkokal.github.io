		<p> <b>We know dating‚Äôs hard. And somehow technology is making it even harder. </b> </p>

			<p>We have more options than ever now, but less human connection. It‚Äôs hard to see who someone is behind their crafted bio and filtered photo. It‚Äôs hard for us to know how to present ourselves on apps that push us to get as many matches as possible. </p>

		<p>We need to <i>see</i> what makes each of our matches unique, and show them what makes <i>us</i> unique. We each need to understand who the other person is, what they care about, how they handle conflict, what makes them happy or sad. We need to understand what makes them <i>human</i>. </p>

		<p>That‚Äôs the only way we can make the right choice about who we date, concentrating our efforts on the matches who have the potential to form a meaningful connection with us, instead of blindly stumbling into relationships that are doomed from the start.</p>

		<p> At Iris, we want to give you the tools you need to not only make better decisions, but to maximize your chances with each of your matches. </p>

		<p>Our algorithm is based on homeopathic philosophy, which believes that each one of us has an innate value system that pops up like a pattern in all aspects of our lives. This value system is expressed at a subconscious level and often bleeds into our speech patterns and word choices. Our NLP engine detects this pattern in a person and maps it to actionable insights you can use to better communicate with them.</p>

		<p>You can use Iris on it‚Äôs own to make new connections, or along with other apps to make the most of your matches. You can even use Iris if you‚Äôre in a relationship.</p>
