			<h2 class="insight1">What They Care About</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image1" onclick="myFunction()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="care"></p>
		<script> function myFunction() { document.getElementById("care").innerHTML = "At their core, they are uncertain about their identity. They are also deeply uncomfortable with any kind of uncertainty or unknown situation. This makes them anxious to define themselves and prove their identity to the people around them. Everything they do serves this ultimate purpose, from they way they dress, to the work they do, to the friends or partners they choose. They are particularly concerned with self-expression and understanding themselves better, and as a result gravitate towards the arts or take up some creative pursuit. They are also sensitive to judgement and criticism from others. They care a great deal about what other people think of them, and tend to define themselves based on their opinions. This pushes them to continually work on improving themselves and prioritize personal growth and development.";}

<h2 class="insight1">How They Communicate</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image2" onclick="myFunction1()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="communicate"></p>
		<script> function myFunction1() { document.getElementById("communicate").innerHTML = "They care about learning and sharing their ideas. They feel that their ideas only become ‚Äúreal‚Äù once they share them with others. As a result, they love bouncing ideas off other people and collaborating on projects. They tend to be passionate and excitable in conversation, and derive great pleasure from intellectual discussions. They ask a lot of questions, and are curious about everything. They are talkative, funny, and playful, but can also be impatient and prone to interrupting others. They feel the need to have an opinion about everything, and are keen to get those opinions across. In fact, they can seem tactless at times and oblivious to how their words will affect others. They will impulsively express their thoughts and feelings, and have no trouble talking back to someone if they don‚Äôt agree with them, even if that person is an authority figure. They can be blunt and insensitive at times, but are ultimately very genuine people.";}
			</script>

<h2 class="insight1">How They Make Decisions</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image3" onclick="myFunction3()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="decisions"></p>
		<script> function myFunction3() { document.getElementById("decisions").innerHTML = "They tend to be rather indecisive and have a hard time distinguishing right from wrong. They rely heavily on guidance and advice from their trusted friends or family. Talking through a problem with someone else often calms them down and helps them make a decision. It also makes them rather suggestible and quick to change their mind based on other people‚Äôs opinions. Their indecision, coupled with impatience, pushes them to make impulsive decisions, before thinking through the consequences. Left to their own devices, they will always do what is fun rather than what is responsible, and often end up regretting their decisions later.";}
			</script>
		<hr class="line">

<h2 class="insight1">How To Make Them Happy</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image4" onclick="myFunction4()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="happy"></p>
		<script> function myFunction4() { document.getElementById("happy").innerHTML = "Because they are sensitive to being judged, and especially to being rejected, they have a difficult time expressing their emotions or being vulnerable. This means that they often will not make the first move, even if they have feelings for you. They will show their interest in you by engaging you in conversation and through playful joking or teasing. They are much more comfortable operating on the intellectual plane than the emotional one, and will try to interact with you on this level, pulling you into deep conversations, or trying to impress you with their mental prowess.";}
			</script>
		<hr class="line">

<h2 class="insight1">Their Perfect Date</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image5" onclick="myFunction5()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="date"></p>
		<script> function myFunction5() { document.getElementById("date").innerHTML = "They want their partner to understand and connect with them on a deep level. What signifies such a connection for them is the ability to have deep, fulfilling conversations, and a shared sense of humor. They are more responsive to affectionate words and touching than to actions and services. They want to feel loved and appreciated, and enjoy being verbally and physically reassured of this. They also likes partners who are expressive about their feelings and explicit about their wants and needs. They like to know where they stand at all times, and are uncomfortable with uncertainty, so a partner that is confident and certain about their relationship will make them very happy, and give them the courage to express their own feelings.";}
			</script>
		<hr class="line">

<h2 class="insight1">How They Show Affection</h2> 
			<button id = "close-image6" onclick="myFunction6()"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TbqcHRh/img-356879.png">
    		</button>  
		<p id="affection"></p>
		<script> function myFunction6() { document.getElementById("affection").innerHTML = "They love spending one-on-one, quality time with their partner. Having great conversations and being in comfortable, familiar environments will make them very happy. After the first few dates, they will typically prefer to stay at home, hanging out in bed, eating and talking, because they feel this to be a more intimate passtime than going out or doing an activity. They can go to the museum or watch a movie with anyone, but doing nothing with someone is a special comfort that requires a deep level of closeness. When you do want to go out with them, however, restaurants are your best bet. They love food, and are very open to trying new cuisines. They also enjoy mentally stimulating activities, like film festivals, art galleries or any high-brow events in the city. ";}
